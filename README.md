# Project Overwiew

This project focuses on the creation of a __rap battle model__ for the course of __Natural Language Processing__ of the  __Artificial Intelligence__ master's program at  __Telecom Paris__. The main objective of this work is to provide a complete approach to develop a rap battle model.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Choose among the next workspace:

- Google Colab account
- Kaggle account

## Steps to develop a model

### 1. Web scrapping: Retrieve all the data from sources (from rap battle websites)

### 2. Data gathering: Put the retrieved data into database

### 3. Data preprocessing: Clean the data and optimize it for the training

### 4. Model training: Use specific algorithms to train our model without taking into account Defender | Challenger architecture

### 5. Model analysis: Play with hyperparameters and check efficience of model (accuracy, loss)

### 6. Model optimization: Whole process to optimize all the previous steps to create a model with Defender | Challenger architecture
